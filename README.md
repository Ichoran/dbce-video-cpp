# dbde-video-cpp
A library for Dynamic Bit Depth Encoded videos in C++ (useful for certain kinds of scientific imaging).

The format was created at HHMI Janelia by Lakshmi Ramasamy.  This is a C++ library to convert frames encoded in DBDE format to and from arrays of pixels, using only the operations found on a modern CPU (at least SSE4.1).
